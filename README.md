# Statistical Data Analysis 

Welcome to the repository for my assignments of the Statistical Data Analysis course at VU Amsterdam. This repository contains R code and associated files for completing the assignments across various topics in statistical analysis. Below is a brief overview of each assignment:

**Assignment 1: Summarizing Data**
- Introduction to summarizing data using descriptive statistics.
- Exploring central tendency, variability, and distributional properties of data.

**Assignment 2: Exploring Distributions, Kernel Density Estimation**
- Further exploration of data distributions.
- Introduction to kernel density estimation for non-parametric density estimation.

**Assignment 3: Kernel Density Estimation, Bootstrap**
- Deeper dive into kernel density estimation techniques.
- Introduction to the bootstrap method for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic.

**Assignment 4: Bootstrap, Nonparametric Tests**
- Continued practice with bootstrap methods.
- Introduction to non-parametric tests for comparing groups or assessing relationships.

**Assignment 5: Nonparametric Tests, Categorical Data**
- Application of non-parametric tests to categorical data.
- Exploring relationships between categorical variables.

**Assignment 6: Categorical Data, Linear Regression**
- Analysis of categorical data using regression techniques.
- Introduction to linear regression for modeling relationships between continuous variables.

**Assignment 7: Linear Regression**
- Further practice with linear regression techniques.
- Application of linear regression to real-world datasets.
